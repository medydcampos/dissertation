All my data and coding for my dissertation topic.

Main theme: trying to identify any relationship between enrollments in high school full time and early pregnancy rate among the amazon municipalities. 

Dependent variable: early pregnancy rate
Independent variable: a dummy that it is equal to one if the municipality has full time education in high school and 0 if it does not. 

Controls: dropouts, approvals, failures, gdp pc and IDH (I am using controls from Benevides et al, 2023).
